# Dotfiles

A terminal and keyboard centric configurations for different set of utilities
and tools I use daily. This repository helps me set up my complete digital
workspace on a new device. It is also cross-platform for Linux and MacOs.

## Features

- A set of dockerfiles which further allows reproducible environments for me to
develop in.
- A collection of scripts that make working in the terminal streamlined and hassle-free.
- Custom configuration manager `dotme`.

## Installation

- Make sure you have `git`, `curl`, and `wget` installed.
- Run `dotme serve` to symlink all configurations.
- Run `setup`
